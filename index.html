            <h1>On the plumage of birds and other matters</h1>
            <p>Birds are variously either magnificent creatures, tasty snacks or detestable vermin, depending on whether they're pigeons, chickens or every other kind of bird (reverse order).</p>
            <p>One of the most important aspects of birds, (which helps us determine whether one is a pigeon and should be held in contempt) is their plumage or feathering for those of us who don't think the word sounds obscene.</p>
            <p>Feathering is superior to fur in a number of ways as it permits gliding and soaring, though it is as useless for transporting coconuts to the northern hemisphere, so it doesn't really matter.</p>

            <h2>Pigeons and their detestable character</h2>
            <p>Although doves get a decent amount of positive publicity, their foul brethren the pigeons deserve nothing but contempt and in this authors' humble opinion should be banned.</p>
            <p>Besides making ridiculous noises, low-flying pedestrian attacks and <em>perching</em>, their droppings are inappropriate enough to dissolve the paint on your environmentally unfriendly automobile. This, naturally, precludes any sort of meaningful bond happening between any reasonble person and on of these fiends.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In conclusion, the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow may be subject to speculation, but the wordly harm caused by pigeons and their ilk certainly is not.</p>
