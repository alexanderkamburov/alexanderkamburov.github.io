            <h1>On the plumage of birds and other matters</h1>
            <p>Birds are variously either magnificent creatures, tasty snacks or ignoble vermin, depending on whether they're pigeons, chickens or every other kind of bird (in reverse order).</p>
            <p>One of the most distinctive features of birds (which helps us determine whether one is a pigeon and should be held in contempt) is their plumage (or feathering for those of us who don't think the word sounds obscene).</p>
            <p>Feathering is superior to fur in a number of ways as it permits gliding and soaring, though it is as useless as fur for transporting coconuts to the northern hemisphere.</p>

            <h2>Pigeons and their detestable character</h2>
            <p>Although doves receive a decent amount of positive publicity, their foul brethren the pigeons deserve nothing short of contempt. Further, in this authors' opinion, they should be banned. </p>
            <p> Many features of this flying freakshow of feathers makes them incompatible with civilised society. Making ridiculous noises, low-flying attacks on pedestrians and <strong><em>perching</em></strong> are just a few of their transgressions.</p>
            <p>It is no exaggeration to say that their droppings are inappropriate enough to dissolve the paint on your environmentally unfriendly automobile or soil your only ok-looking suit. As a pigeon-attack survivor, the author can attest to their feverish ferocity for fatalities. This, naturally, precludes any sort of meaningful bond between reasonable people and these feathered fiends.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow may be subject to speculation, but the wordly harm caused by pigeons and their ilk certainly is not.</p>
